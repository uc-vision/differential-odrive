in odrive_interface.pu

    removed from fibre import ChanelBrokenException (seems to be deprecated in current odrive python library)

    changed vel_setpoint to input_vel

    in calibrate() changed AXIS_STATE_FULL_CALIBRATION to AXIS_STATE_ENCODER_OFFSET_CALIBRATION

    in engage() changed CTRL_MODE_VELOCITY_CONTROL to CTRL_MODE_VELOCITY_CONTROL

    Should add velocity ramp config
